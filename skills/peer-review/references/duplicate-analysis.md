# Duplicate Analysis

## The test

Two findings are **duplicates** when both hold:
1. **Same root cause**: the same wrong assumption or missing step, not merely the same function.
2. **Same fix**: one change closes both.

Everything else is **related**: same function, same symptom, same theme, opposite directions of the
same tracker, or two bugs whose fixes touch the same lines. Related findings get a cross-reference,
and often a note that their fixes must land together.

## How to check

For each candidate (from the duplicates index, a grep of the mirror for the same `file:line`, and the
findings that mention the same state variables):

1. Write each root cause in one sentence. If the sentences differ in *what is wrong*, not just *where*,
   they are probably distinct.
2. Ask what each fix does to the other finding's PoC. When cheap, run it: apply fix A, run PoC B.
3. Check direction. A tracker that is wrong **too high** in one finding and **too low** in the other is
   two bugs, even on the same variable.
4. Check triggers. "Fee or loss writes down X" and "price path writes down X" are different triggers;
   if the fixes differ, they are different findings.

## Symptom vs root

A finding is a **symptom** of another when the other's fix removes it. Example pattern: a protected
bucket that never absorbs losses can show up as a revert in one state, an inflated claim in another, a
blocked price update in a third, and a failing payout in a fourth. One change (writing the bucket down
when nothing backs it) closes all four. Present those as a cluster:

| Condition | Symptom | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| state A | revert | #a |
| state B | inflated claim | #b |
| ... | ... | ... |

Then name the single fix and say which local fixes become defence in depth.

## Resolved by another finding's fix

Always consider this verdict, even when no candidate passes the duplicate test. A finding can be
closed as **resolved by another finding's fix** when that fix removes its precondition or impact, even
if the roots differ and the fixes close in one direction only. Example pattern: finding B says "path X
ignores the reservation that path Y applies", and finding A's fix makes that reservation always zero.
B's own fix would not close A, but after A's fix B has nothing left to bypass.

1. For each related finding, find its fix. Prefer the client's actual commit (linked in the issue's
   comments, or the "Client: Proposed Fix" label) over the finding's suggested diff.
2. Apply it to the audited code in an isolated copy inside the workspace, always
   (`scripts/verify-fix.sh`, or `scripts/isolated-workspace.sh` for manual runs; see
   `parallel-sessions.md`). When hunks don't apply because the trees diverged, adapt them and say which.
3. Run the reviewed finding's PoC and the regression suite before and after. Note which assertion
   now fails; it shows *where* the scenario breaks.
4. Check in code that the precondition cannot come back (every path that creates it is now covered),
   not only that this PoC stops.
5. If both hold, recommend closing as resolved by that fix. Say why the precondition is gone, what is
   left of the scenario and where it is tracked (another finding, a documented runbook), and which
   neighbours stay open.

It is a judgement call, not a rule: report the strict duplicate result separately, and present the
closure as a suggestion with the evidence. If the other fix is only proposed, not merged, say the
closure depends on it landing as tested.

## The user's own findings

Always check whether the finding under review duplicates something the user filed, drafted, or is
about to submit:
- **The user filed later with the same root**: the user's issue will be closed as a duplicate. Move
  its extra impact (a stronger scenario, a cross-instance effect) into an additional-impact comment on
  the earlier issue, close the user's issue, and add the user as co-assignee.
- **The user has an unsubmitted draft**: don't submit it separately. Use it to rewrite or extend the
  filed finding, and justify the co-assignment by what it adds.
- **The user's rewrite of a finding**: it is a rewrite, not a new finding, even if the PoC and numbers
  differ. Keep the source link.

## When a judge might merge broader

Mention it when a broad framing could swallow several findings ("trackers don't keep a cost basis"),
and argue for or against the merge using the fix test. Keep groups the project's duplicates index
already separates unless a fix test shows otherwise.
